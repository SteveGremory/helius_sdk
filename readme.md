# Unofficial Helius SDK

After not really finding a python wrapper around the WS and RPC API that suited my needs, I wrote one. Partially.

# API

All the RPC and WS endpoints have been mapped to their respective python functions and have been grouped together on the basis of functionality.

# Documentation

There's a few basic examples in the repo, but `pdoc` can be used to summarize them until I add better documentation.
